# [MetroidVania.GG](https://metroidvania.gg)

MetroidVania.GG or MV.GG for short is a information hub for everything related to the videogame sub-gerne "metroidvanias". The majority of these games are made by small studios or even just a single person. Therefore sometimes it's hard to find these games. 
The **main** goal of the website is to signalboost metroidvanias that have either released or are still in development. 

## Backend

Note: The repo for the frontend of this site resides here: [https://github.com/Xoneris/Metroidvania.GG-Frontend](https://github.com/Xoneris/Metroidvania.GG-Frontend)

This is currently a WIP. Eventually I want to switch from my current Django Backend to this Laravel Backend. This project already has a few api endpoints which are not available on the Django project. However these are not production ready yet. My skills so far with Laravel are very basic but I already enjoy working with it way more then I do with Django.

I will provide a full list of api endpoints at a later date. 

The backend of this website was made with [Laravel](https://laravel.com).
